# ABE_Practice

This is the Python/Bash implementation of the ABE Practice (Attribute-Based Encryption) of the Data Protection and Cibersecurity course of the University Carlos III de Madrid.

The aim of this project is to automatize the deployment and encryption/decryption process as well analyzing the scalability of this approach when dealing with different number of users and attributes.

For Attribute-Based Encrypted [Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bwaters/publications/papers/cp-abe.pdf) (CPABE) was used. CPABE is developed by John Bethencourt (Carnegie Mellon University), Amit Sahai (UCLA, advisory role), Brent Waters (SRI International, advisory role) and [licensed](https://acsc.cs.utexas.edu/cpabe/) under the GNU GPL license.
